# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets such as images, stylesheets, and other media files.

## Structure

- **images/**: Store all image files here (e.g., logos, icons, backgrounds).
- **styles/**: Store global CSS or SCSS files here. For component-specific styles, consider using CSS Modules or styled-components within the component's directory.

## Guidelines

- Organize assets into subdirectories based on their type (e.g., images, styles).
- Use descriptive file names for assets to make it easy to understand their purpose.
- Compress images and optimize them for web use to improve performance.
