# Components directory

This directory contains reusable React components

- **common/**: Shared components used throughout the application, such as `Header`, `Footer`, etc.
- **feature-specific components**: Components specific to certain features or pages.

When adding a new component, consider if it can be reused elsewhere. If so, place it in the `common/` directory.
